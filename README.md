# ðŸ’¼ Tech Salary Prediction

Predicting tech industry salaries based on experience, job role, skills, and location using Python and Power BI.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build a regression model that can accurately predict salaries in the tech industry using various input features. The objective is to help hiring managers and candidates make data-driven compensation decisions.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Data Processing**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Source**: Public tech salary datasets (e.g., Stack Overflow Survey)

---

## ðŸ§ª Workflow & Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Categorical encoding (job title, location, experience level)
   - Feature scaling for numerical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of salaries by role, location, and experience
   - Correlation analysis between features and salary

3. **Model Building**
   - Used multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Model tuning using GridSearchCV
   - Evaluated with RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² Score

4. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Created an interactive dashboard to visualize salary trends by role, region, and skills
   - Linked dashboard to model predictions for business use

## âœ… Results

- Achieved **85% accuracy** (RÂ² Score) using the Random Forest model.
- Identified key predictors: **job title**, **years of experience**, and **location**.
- Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize salary predictions and trends.
